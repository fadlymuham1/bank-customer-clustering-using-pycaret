# Mall Customer Clustering Using Pycaret Lybrary
This time, I , and some of my collagues did a simple machine learning project using new tool called Pycaret. We were utilizing the strength of Pycaret which is automatically doing pre-processing and running multiple models with only several line of codes.

Type of Machine Learning : Un-supervised Machine Learning

Programming Language : Python

Conclusion:

1. Compared with other clustering models, based on the comparative scores (Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin) the K-Means model is the best model for Mall Customers data.
2. Based on the elbow plot and silhouette plot, the best cluster for the K-Means model is 4.
3. Based on the score comparison, the K-Means model with 4 clusters is better than the K-Means 3 cluster model. So K-Means with 4 Clusters is the best model for Mall Customers data clustering.
